          Utilization Management (UM) decision making is based only on appropriateness of care and service and existence of coverage. Americo IPA does not specifically

          Americo IPA does not offer financial incentives to UM decision makers that
          encourage decisions that result in underutilization.
          Our practitioners are ensured independence and impartiality in making referral
          decisions that will not influence hiring, compensation, termination, promotion or any other similar matters.
